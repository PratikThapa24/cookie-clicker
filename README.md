Cookie Clicker Bot:
This project involves building a program that automates the process of clicking cookies and purchasing items in the popular game called Cookie Clicker.

Selenium WebDriver:
Selenium WebDriver is a tool that allows us to automate web browsers. In this project, we'll be using Selenium WebDriver to control a web browser and perform actions on the Cookie Clicker website.

Time Library:
The time library in Python provides functions to handle time-related operations. We'll be using it to introduce delays in the program, ensuring that the bot doesn't perform actions too quickly.

Accessing the Cookie Clicker Website:
The bot starts by opening a web browser and navigating to the Cookie Clicker website. Selenium WebDriver allows the program to interact with the website's elements, such as the cookie and the store.

Automating Clicking Cookies:
Once on the Cookie Clicker website, the bot uses Selenium WebDriver to locate and click the cookie element. This action simulates the manual process of clicking cookies in the game.

Tracking Cookie Count and Purchasing Items:
The bot keeps track of the number of cookies it has accumulated. If the bot has enough cookies, it will use Selenium WebDriver to navigate to the store and purchase expensive items. This automation saves time by automatically buying items that require a large number of cookies.

Introducing Delays:
To make the bot's actions more human-like, the time library is used to introduce delays between clicks and purchases. These delays ensure that the bot doesn't perform actions too quickly and imitates human interaction with the game.

Repeat and Optimize:
The bot continues clicking cookies and purchasing items until it reaches a predefined limit or achieves a desired goal. It can be programmed to optimize its purchases based on predefined strategies, such as prioritizing items that increase cookie production.

By automating the process of clicking cookies and purchasing items in Cookie Clicker, this bot saves time and effort by performing repetitive tasks automatically. However, it's essential to note that using automation tools like this may affect the intended gameplay experience, and it's important to use such tools responsibly and within the guidelines set by the game developers.
